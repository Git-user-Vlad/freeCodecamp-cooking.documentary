                    <div class="pannel">
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
                            <li>½ tbsp garlic granules</li>
                            <li>50g plain flour</li>
                            <li>200g buttermilk (195ml)</li>
                            <li>1 medium cauliflower (around 750g), leaves removed and cut into florets</li>
                            <li>100g hot sauce</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp honey or maple syrup</li>

                        <li>Combine the paprika, cumin, garlic granules, flour, buttermilk and a good pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper in a bowl and mix well to make a smooth batter. Add the cauliflower florets and mix to coat the cauliflower.</li>
                        <li>Put the cauliflower florets in the air fryer basket in a single layer, shaking off any excess batter as you do so. You may need to cook in batches depending on the size of the basket. Cook on 200C for 18-20 mins, turning half way through, until browned on the edges.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, combine the hot sauce, olive oil and honey or maple syrup, if using, in a large bowl. Add the cooked cauliflower and set aside while you cook your next batch, if necessary. Gently mix all of the cooked cauliflower and hot sauce to coat. Finally, return all of the cauliflower to your air fryer basket and cook for 6-9 mins until hot and well cooked through.</li>

                            <li>180g plain flour</li>
                            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                            <li>2 oranges, zested</li>
                            <li>2 tsp mixed spice</li>
                            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
                            <li>50g icing sugar</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Mix the cocoa, caster sugar and oil together. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking until fully combined.</li>
                        <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, orange zest, mixed spice, cinnamon and a pinch of salt in a separate bowl, then add to the cocoa mixture and mix until a soft dough forms. If it feels too soft, put in the fridge to chill for 1 hr.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and tip the icing sugar into a shallow dish. Roll heaped teaspoons of the dough into balls (about 20g each), then roll in the icing sugar to coat. Put the balls on one large or two medium baking trays lined with baking parchment, ensuring they’re evenly spaced apart.</li>
                        <li>Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool – they will firm up as they cool, but still be fudgy in the centre. Will keep for up to four days in an airtight container.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>120g butter, softened</li>

                            <li>1 medium egg</li>
                            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>180g plain flour</li>
                            <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
                            <li>150g dark chocolate, cut into chunks</li>

                        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment. Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla. Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
                        <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool. Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>

                            <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
                            <li>125g pack blueberries (or use frozen)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases. Beat the butter and caster sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs and beat in for 1 min, then mix in the yogurt, vanilla extract and milk. Combine the flour, baking powder and bicarb in a bowl with ¼ tsp fine salt, then tip this into the wet ingredients and stir in. Finally, fold in the blueberries and divide the mixture between the muffin cases.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 5 mins, then reduce oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and bake for 15-18 mins more until risen and golden, and a cocktail stick inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
                        <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then carefully lift out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. Will keep for 3-4 days in an airtight container – after a day or two, pop them in the microwave for 10-15 secs on high to freshen up.</li>

                    <p>Take indulgent, fudgy chocolate brownies to the next level with a layer of salted caramel running through the centre of each bite.</p>
                    <div class="pannel">
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>200g unsalted butter, plus a little extra for greasing</li>
                            <li>100g chocolate, 70% cocoa solids</li>
                            <li>100g chocolate, 50% cocoa solids</li>
                            <li>397g can caramel</li>
                            <li>1 tsp flaky sea salt, plus a little extra for the top</li>
                            <li>200g golden caster sugar</li>
                            <li>4 medium eggs, at room temperature</li>
                            <li>130g plain flour</li>
                            <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
                        <li>Grease then line a 23cm square traybake tin with baking parchment.</li>
                        <li>Melt 200g unsalted butter in a medium pan, break in 100g chocolate (70% cocoa solids) and 100g chocolate (50% cocoa solids), then remove the pan from the heat and wait for the cubes to melt.</li>
                        <li>In a small bowl, mix 175g caramel from a 397g can with 1 tsp sea salt – it will loosen up.</li>
                        <li>Put the rest of the caramel in a large bowl with 200g golden caster sugar and 4 medium eggs, and beat with an electric hand mixer or balloon whisk until even. Whisk in the chocolate and butter.</li>
                        <li>In another bowl, combine 130g plain flour, 50g cocoa powder and a good pinch of table salt, then sift this on top of the chocolate mix. Beat briefly until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Pour half the brownie batter into the tin and level it with a spatula.</li>
                        <li>Using a teaspoon, spoon half of the salted caramel on top of the batter layer in 5 thick, evenly spaced stripes.</li>
                        <li>Spoon the rest of the brownie batter on top and smooth it out, trying not to disturb the caramel beneath. Top with the rest of the caramel in the same stripy fashion. Drag a skewer or tip of a knife through the caramel to make a feathered pattern on the top.</li>
                        <li>Scatter with a little more sea salt, then bake for 25-30 mins or until risen all the way to the middle with a firm crust on top. When ready, the brownie will jiggle just a little when you shake the tin.</li>
                        <li>Let it cool completely in the tin, then cut into squares.</li>

                    <p>These sweet and sticky treats are best made a day in advance - perfect if you need to get ahead for a bake sale</p>
                    <div class="pannel">
                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>200g soft brown sugar</li>
                            <li>200g butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
                            <li>350g whole oats</li>
                            <li>397g can caramel</li>
                            <li>200g plain chocolate</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp unflavoured oil, like sunflower</li>
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Place the sugar, butter and golden syrup together in a saucepan and gently heat until the butter has melted, stirring occasionally. Take the saucepan off the heat and stir in the oats, mixing thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a lined and lightly greased 22cm square tin, pressing it out evenly using the back of a wooden spoon. Bake in the centre of the oven for 40-45 mins.</li>
                        <li>Allow the mixture to cool in the tin for 10 mins (or for best results, leave to cool completely overnight), then evenly spread over the caramel. There can be discrepancies between the thickness of caramel, and the more you stir the runnier it gets. If it looks too thin pop it into a pan and boil for a few minutes, stirring. Then leave to cool - it should be thicker. Chill until firm.</li>
                        <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, then stir in the oil and pour over the chilled caramel flapjack base. Let the chocolate set, then cut into squares. Setting chocolate on top of something squidgy can make it difficult to cut, this is why the oil is added.</li>

                    <p>Chocolate and cake are two of our favourite things, so what's not to love about this indulgent cake?</p>

To make the loaf cake batter, beat the butter and sugar with an electric whisk until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, flour, almonds, baking powder, milk and cocoa until smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips, then scrape into the tin. Bake for 45-50 mins until golden, risen and a skewer poked in the centre comes out clean.</li>
                        <li>Cool in the tin, then lift out onto a wire rack over some kitchen paper. Melt the extra chocolate chunks separately in pans over barely simmering water, or in bowls in the microwave, then use a spoon to drizzle each in turn over the cake. Leave to set before slicing.</li>
